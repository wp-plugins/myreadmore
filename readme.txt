== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why do I need this? =

Hyperlinks should clearly indicate their targets, so that users know in advance what to expect, should they choose to open them.

- If you want your website to be accessible (<strong>and to pass automatic accessibility validators</strong>) you need to fix this issue.

To avoid this repetition, we should use different text links to different content. 

This plugin is about achieving that in a straightforward way, making your website overall more accessible to all users.

= How can I configure the dynamic message to replace the default "Read More" link? =

In the <strong>myReadMore panel</strong>, you can enter the "constant" word or words you wish to use to replace the default "Read more" hyperlink. 

Then you will choose how many of the post-title-words you wish to add to it, to make a unique "continue reading" link.

Example: after filling the "constant" field with: "Click and read more about" and choose 3 as the number of post-title-words to be read, you will end up with something like: 

"Click and read more about <em>your-post-title</em>"
